# kelsiWorld3D
Kelsi's epic battle with the printer in 3D

## Installation
You need some sort of bundler. What I recommend is parcel. It's already included in the package json so if you do `npm install`
then you can do parcel index.html
This will automatically do the bundling and file hosting for you. 
Navigate to localhost:1234 or whatever port you specified to play

## Instructions
Use wasd to control character position, and mouse to aim.
